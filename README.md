# Custom Contracts
Custom Contracts is a Farming Simulator 25 mod that enables player-to-player contracting on multiplayer servers.
Instead of relying only on AI-generated jobs, players can create, accept, manage, and complete contracts for real work between farms — with fair payments, clear status tracking, and a realistic workflow.

Whether you’re helping a neighbor harvest a field or running a professional contracting business, Custom Contracts adds a new layer of realism and cooperation to FS25.

## Important
This is super early in development and might not work 100%. I hope to implement core features rather quickly, but I can't guarantee it.
